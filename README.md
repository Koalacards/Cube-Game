# Cube-Game
The first game that I created, worked on from October 2016-Early 2017. The premise of the game is to use the left and right arrow keys to go off ramps, propel into fans, use jetpacks and other tools to traverse courses and chase after an antagonist who stole your ice cream. The game was eventually scrapped due to a lack of programming knowledge and poor base code.
