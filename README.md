# Cube-Game
The first game that I created, worked on from October 2017-Early 2018. The premise of the game is to use the left and right arrow keys to go off ramps, propel into fans, use jetpacks and other tools to traverse courses and chase after an antagonist who stole your ice cream. The game was eventually scrapped due to a lack of programming knowledge and poor base code.
